        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method. The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden brown in the olive oil. If it's too light, you don't get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My advice? Do it perfectly.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound uncooked spaghetti</li>
            <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>6 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped parsley</li>
            <li>1 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, grated</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl.</li>
            <li>While the pasta is cooking, combine olive oil and garlic in a cold skillet.</li>
            <li>Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Stir red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into pasta.</li>
            <li>Pour in hot olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; toss until combined.</li>
            <li>Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
        </ol>
